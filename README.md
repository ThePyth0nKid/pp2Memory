## Footer with social media icons

Social media links in the footer which are linked to the homepage of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok as Fuut does not have its own social media profile. Just like the header, structured, minimal, responsive, perfect for my first website

## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles, I began by contemplating the strategy for this website, defining the target users and the features/technologies they would desire.

Target Users for Cyberpunk Memory:

- Aged 18-99
- Enthusiasts of technology and early adopters
- Individuals with a keen interest in sustainable and automated gaming experiences
- Gamers and puzzle enthusiasts looking for a unique challenge

Key Expectations of the Users:

- Clarity and Simplicity: Users should easily find their way around the game interface.
- Immersive Visuals: Engaging cyberpunk-themed graphics that draw players into the dystopian world.
- Challenging Gameplay: Memory puzzles that provide both entertainment and mental stimulation.


### **Structure**

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed.

## Testing

First of all, I tested all the functions myself. Then I validated and tested everything as standard using all the means listed.

### **Lighthouse**

Lighthouse is a feature of Google Chrome developer tools and is used to assess the performance of the website and its features.

### **HTML and CSS Validation**

I validated both my HTML and CSS. At first I had a few errors but they were easy to find and fix

![HTML Error1](assets/images/html-check-problems1.png)

So that in the end there were no more errors.

2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
